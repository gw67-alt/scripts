**ZERO POINT PERSPECTIVE**

**CHARACTER:**

* **THE MAN:** Suave, experienced, unflappable. Sitting in a comfortable, perhaps slightly exotic, setting.

**SETTING:**

A dimly lit, luxurious study or lounge. Books line the walls, perhaps a few unusual artifacts are visible.

**(THE MAN sits in a high-backed leather chair, holding a drink. He looks directly at the camera/audience, thoughtful but amused.)**

**THE MAN:**
There are states of being the average person rarely contemplates. Journeys beyond the map.

(He swirls his drink gently)

Take dimensions, for example. We navigate our familiar three quite capably. Some even dabble in the fourth. But the true connoisseur... well, one explores.

(He pauses, taking a sip)

I don't *always* exist in zero dimensions. Frankly, it lacks elbow room. A single point, you see. Not ideal for appreciating a fine beverage.

(He leans forward slightly, a twinkle in his eye)

But when I *do* find myself momentarily... dimensionless? It's my superior colliculus failing. A peculiar little glitch in the visual cortex's spatial command center, wouldn't you know. Quite inconvenient, but thankfully brief.

(He raises his glass slightly)

One always snaps back. Usually in time for the next round. Stay anchored, my friends. Mostly.

**(He gives a subtle, knowing smile and takes another sip.)**
